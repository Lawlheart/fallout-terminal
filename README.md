#Fallout Terminal
##### by Kaia

Recreation of the hacking minigame in fallout 4

##### I learned

 - How to spoof terminal cursor movements using jquery event handlers
 - How to randomize a wordlist with variable filler characters
 - How to generate a list of similar words from a large pool of words

##### Skills used 

 - AngularJS
 - JavaScript
 - jQuery
 - AJAX
 - HTML5
 - CSS3

##### User Stories

 - I can start a game with 16 randomized words, one of which is the password
 - I can guess which word is the password
 - If I get a correct guess, I'm shown a winning screen
 - If my guess is incorrect, I'm shown a 'likeness' score depending on how similar the word is to the password
 - If I get 4 wrong guesses without a reset, I'm shown a losing screen
 - I can find 'hacks' in the code, non-word characters enclosed by a set of brackets
 - I can select these hacks to get an incorrect word removed or my tries reset
 - I can see my selection output on the sidebar
 - On the game over screen or the win screen I can press enter to play again

##### Progress
 - Working randomization and display
 - Working cursor movement
 - cursor recognizes and highlights full words
 - make cursor recognize and highlight bracketed items
 - select word
 - remove dud function
 - guess function that compares to password and returns matching characters
 - sidebar text
 - completion screen/ game over screen
 - randomize words
 - make random words similar

##### Next Steps

 - Typing effect
